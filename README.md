## The comparison of Merge,Insertion, Quick and Heap sorting algorithms


[Research Paper](https://github.com/Yakub28/Comparison-of-the-sorting-algorithms/blob/master/ResearchPaper.pdf)


### Intro
In this project, the research on sorting was done and the fastest algorithm was found among insertion sort, merge sort, quciksort and heap sort. The problem wass to create an array or possibly vector of n integers which should be sorted by each and every algorithm of the given.

### Methodology
Programming language which was used is C++. The outputs were produced for 3 random vectors. The algorithms were used for vectors of size from 100 up to 10000 with the gap to be 100.The second step was in measuring the arrays with the size up to 500, the last testing was done on the arrays with the less than 100 elements. Each array size was tested 100 times. In the result the time of sorting indicated.

### Results
The resulted from the measurements graphs are depicted below:

### Conclusion
In conclusion, generally quick sort is the fastest one for the big arrays and 
insertion sort is in the winning position for the arrays with less than 75 members, seeing that hybrid sort was constructed being the combination of quick sort and insertion sort.
